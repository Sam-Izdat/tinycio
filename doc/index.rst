=======================================

.. rubric:: color stuff for people who don't science too good

A primitive, lightweight Python color library for PyTorch-involved projects. It implements color space conversion, tone mapping, LUT usage and creation, basic color correction and color balancing, and HDR-LDR encoding/decoding. 

Getting started
---------------

* Recommended: set up a clean Python environment
* `Install PyTorch  as instructed here <https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/>`_
* Run :code:`pip install tinycio`
* Run :code:`tcio-setup` (installs freeimage binaries; `iio docs on fi <https://imageio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/_autosummary/imageio.plugins.freeimage.html#module-imageio.plugins.freeimage>`_)

About 
-----
Release version 
|version|
|release|

.. rubric:: Requires

- PyTorch >=2.0 (earlier versions untested)
- NumPy >=1.21
- imageio >=2.9 (with PNG-FI FreeImage plugin)
- tqdm >=4.64
- toml >=0.10

As pip has a tendency to screw up PyTorch installations, torch is deliberately left out of 
the explicit package requirements; install it whichever way is most appropriate, if you 
haven't done so already.

.. rubric:: Note on limitations

I feel like a disclaimer is in order.

* This package is (obviously) not suitable for realtime rendering
* This package is *generally* not suitable for differentiable rendering
* I am not a color expert and can't guarantee scientific accuracy

This package was motivated by a frustration with the staggering complexities of digital color and put together 
as part of a larger project, already using PyTorch, to minimize external dependencies. In self-flattering terms, 
the goal here is a kind of spartan-utilitarian approach to color for image processing with some light machine learning. 
In less self-flattering terms, I have no idea what I'm doing. This is not meant to be a replacement for a proper 
color management solution.

While the code was tested within reason, some things are likely still not quite correct. For dependable color management, 
`defer to OCIO <https://opencolorio.org/>`_ or consider a more comprehensive and scientifically-minded Python 
project like `Colour <https://www.colour-science.org/>`_.
